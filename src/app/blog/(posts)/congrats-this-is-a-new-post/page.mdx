## O problema

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

## Where does it come from?

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

```tsx
// Using 'typeof' to infer types
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
type PersonType = typeof person; // { name: string; age: number }

// 'satisfies' to ensure a type matches but allows more specific types
type Animal = { name: string };
const dog = { name: "Buddy", breed: "Golden Retriever" } satisfies Animal;

// Generics with 'extends' and default values
function identity<T extends number | string = string>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

let str = identity(); // Default type is string
let num = identity(42); // T inferred as number

// 'extends' with interface and class
interface HasLength {
  length: number;
}

function logLength<T extends HasLength = string>(arg: T): void {
  console.log(arg.length);
}

logLength("Hello"); // OK: string has length (default is string)
logLength([1, 2, 3]); // OK: array has length
// logLength(123);      // Error: number doesn't have length

// 'typeof' with functions
function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}

type AddFunctionType = typeof add; // (x: number, y: number) => number

// Generic interfaces with 'extends' and default types
interface Box<T extends object = { message: string }> {
  content: T;
}

let defaultBox: Box = { content: { message: "Hello" } }; // Uses default type
let customBox: Box<{ status: number }> = { content: { status: 200 } };

// Complex example with 'satisfies' and default generics
type Task = {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  completed: boolean;
};

const myTask = {
  title: "Learn TypeScript",
  completed: false,
  priority: "High",
} satisfies Task; // Allows priority but ensures Task structure

// Generic function with default type
function wrapInArray<T = string>(value: T): T[] {
  return [value];
}

const stringArray = wrapInArray(); // Default to string
const numberArray = wrapInArray(42); // T inferred as number

/**
 * Combines two generic types into a tuple.
 *
 * @template T - The first type.
 * @template U - The second type.
 * @param {T} first - The first value.
 * @param {U} second - The second value.
 * @returns {[T, U]} A tuple containing both values.
 */
function combine<T, U>(first: T, second: U): [T, U] {
  return [first, second];
}
```

## Why do we use it?

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
